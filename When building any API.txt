Developer Thinking Checklist

When building any API, think in this order:

Purpose: What does it do?
Tables/Entities: Which DB tables or business logic does it touch?
Inputs: What does the client send? (GET params, POST body, form-data, JSON)
Processing: How will I query/filter/process data?

Security: Use prepared statements, validate inputs.

Output: What JSON structure will I send back?

Testing: Try different scenarios in Postman.
